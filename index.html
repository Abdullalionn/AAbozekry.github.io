                    My name is Abdullah, and I'm 14 years old. I live in Egypt with my parents and my younger brothers.

                I've always loved computers. I remember when I was 10 years old, I would spend hours playing with my dad's old computer.
                 I would type in random commands and see what would happen. I was fascinated by the way computers could do anything I wanted them to.
                  When I was 12 years old, I started learning how to program. I found a Ebook at the E-library about Python, and I started reading it.
                   I was immediately hooked. I loved the way Python was so easy to read and write. I could see how I could use it to create anything I
                   could imagine. I spent hours every day learning Python. I would read books, watch tutorials, and practice writing code. I was a quick 
                   learner, and I soon became proficient in Python.  </p>

               was 12, and I've gotten really good at it. I love the way I can use photo editing to change the 
               way things look. I can make a boring photo look exciting, or a bad photo look good. I can even 
               make myself look like a different person.I'm not sure why I love photo editing so much. Maybe
                it's because I'm creative, or maybe it's because I like to control the way things look. 
                Whatever the reason, I'm glad that I found something that I'm passionate about. 
                Photo editing has helped me in a lot of ways. It's helped me to express my creativity,
                 and it's also helped me to build my confidence. I'm not afraid to show my work to other
                  people, and I'm not afraid to take criticism. I know that I can always improve, and that's 
                  what drives me to keep learning.

              time I saw my older brother editing a video for school. I was amazed at how he could take all of these different pieces of footage and put
               them together to create something that was both entertaining and informative. I begged him to teach me how to do it, and he was happy to 
               oblige. I quickly picked up the basics of video editing, and I soon started making my own videos. 
                I would film my friends playing games, or I would make short films based on my favorite vid
