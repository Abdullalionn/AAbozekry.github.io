                            <p class="Aboutme_p">My name is Abdullah and I'm 14 years old. I've been coding for about 2 years now and I absolutely love it. I started out with Python, which is 
                                a great language for beginners. It's easy to learn and there are a lot of resources available online. Once I had a good understanding of Python, I moved on to 
                                HTML and CSS. These languages are used to create websites and they're essential for any web developer. I'm currently learning JavaScript, which is a powerful 
                                language that can be used to create interactive websites and web applications.<br><br><br>

                                I love coding because it's a creative outlet for me. I enjoy coming up with new ideas and seeing them come to life in code. I also like the challenge of solving problems. Coding can be difficult at times, but it's also very rewarding. I'm constantly learning new things and I feel like I'm always growing as a developer.<br><br><br>
                                
                                I'm not sure what I want to do with my life after high school, but I know that I want to keep coding. I'm hoping to get a job as a web developer or software engineer. I also want to start my own business one day. I think coding is the future and I want to be a part of it.<br><br><br>
                                
                                If you're interested in learning how to code, I highly recommend it. It's a great skill to have and it can open up a lot of opportunities for you. There are a lot of great resources available online, so you don't need to go to school to learn how to code. Just start with the basics and keep practicing. You'll be surprised at how much you can learn in a short amount of time.<br><br><br>
                                
                                I'm excited to see what the future holds for me as a coder. I know that I have a lot to learn, but I'm confident that I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I'm excited to see what the future holds for the world of coding as well. I think coding is going to change the world in a lot of ways, and I'm excited to be a part of that change.</p>
