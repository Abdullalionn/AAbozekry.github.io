                            <p class="programming_p">I've always been interested in computers, and I started learning how to code when I was in high school. I was fascinated by the idea of being able to create something from scratch, and I loved the challenge of solving problems with code.

                                Since then, I've learned a lot about programming, and I've created a variety of projects, including websites, games, and even a few mobile apps. I'm always looking for new challenges, and I'm excited to see what the future holds for me as a programmer.
                                
                                I'm particularly interested in using programming to create educational games and simulations. I believe that games can be a powerful tool for learning, and I'm excited to see how I can use my skills to create games that are both fun and educational.
                                
                                I'm also interested in using programming to solve real-world problems. I believe that programming can be used to make the world a better place, and I'm excited to see how I can use my skills to make a positive impact.</p>

I've been editing videos since I was in high school, and I've always loved the creative process of taking raw footage and turning it into something new and exciting. I love the feeling of being able to tell a story through video, and I'm always looking for new ways to use editing to tell my stories in a unique way.

                                I've edited videos for a variety of projects, including short films, music videos, and promotional videos. I'm also a big fan of montages, and I love the challenge of creating a montage that tells a story or conveys a message in a short amount of time.
                                
                                I'm always learning new things about video editing, and I'm always looking for new ways to improve my skills. I'm excited to see what the future holds for me in video editing, and I can't wait to continue creating new and exciting videos.</p>

                            <p class="programming_p"> I find it to be a very creative and rewarding process, and I love the feeling of taking a mediocre photo and turning it into something truly special. I've been editing photos for about 5 years now, and I've learned a lot along the way. I've learned how to use different editing software, how to fix common photo problems, and how to add creative effects. I've also learned how to use photo editing to tell stories and convey emotions.

                                I'm always looking for new ways to improve my photo editing skills, and I'm always experimenting with new techniques. I'm also a big fan of learning from other photographers, and I follow a lot of talented photo editors on social media.
                                
                                I'm passionate about photo editing, and I believe that it's a powerful tool that can be used to create beautiful and meaningful images. I hope to continue learning and growing as a photo editor, and I hope to one day share my work with the world.</p>
